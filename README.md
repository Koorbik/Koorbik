# 👋 Hey, I’m Hubert Szadkowski!
  
I’m a Computer Science student who’s been writing code since before I could drive, and I love turning ideas into interactive web apps and intelligent AI systems.  
If I’m not busy wrangling code, you’ll find me enjoying dark humor, tackling souls-like games (with a healthy dose of rage), or perfecting my next home-cooked meal—ideally with a beer and friends.

## 🚀 About Me

- 💼 **Full Stack & Backend Engineer**  
  Crafting robust digital experiences—whether it’s a blazing-fast monolith, a swarm of microservices, or cutting-edge AI.

- 🤖 **AI Explorer**  
  From neural nets to computer vision, if it learns, I’m interested.

- 🏃 **On a Mission:**  
  Writing code since age 12, still just as curious and motivated (but with better syntax).
